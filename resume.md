I am a fun, confident, hardworking, creative, trustworthy and reliable individual with a
huge imagination.

I have recently graduated from Staffordshire University in Computer Games Design. I
strive to become a 3D Environment Artist as I enjoy designing and building environment pieces. I have many unique and interesting ideas which I believe will be invaluable to the industry.

## Key Skills & Achievements

I have acquired a wide range of skills in Computer Games Design from GCSE to
degree level. My education has helped develop skills such as punctuality,
communication, teamwork and a great eye for detail. I thrive on working to strict
deadlines and under pressure. One of my biggest achievements is working on a university project  in the role of a producer. I managed a group of 25 students to create a survival horror game. My task involved organising students, task management, project planning and environment design.
