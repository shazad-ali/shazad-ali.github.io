## Personal Statement

I am a fun, confident, hardworking, creative, trustworthy and reliable individual with a
huge imagination.

I have recently graduated from Staffordshire university in computer games design. I
strive to become a 3D Environment Artist by practicing, evolving and adapting to new
experiences. I love designing and building environment pieces and working in a
team. I have many unique and interesting ideas which I would love to express to the
industry.

## Key Skills & Achievements

I've acquired a wide range of skills in Computer Games Design from GCSE to
degree level. This has helped expand my skill set with exceptional punctuality,
communication and teamwork, with a great eye for detail. I enjoy working to strict
deadlines and working under pressure accurately and efficiently. For example, I have
worked in a university project taking the role of a producer. I managed a group of 25
students to create a survival horror game. My task involved organising students, task
management, project planning and environment design.
