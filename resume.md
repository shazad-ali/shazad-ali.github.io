I have recently graduated from Staffordshire University in Computer Games Design. I am an
Animator and Environment Artist. Design is a skill, a thing of beauty, it flows in my imagination
and i bring ideas into life. I get excited about video games, whilst appreciating the hard work and
effort it takes to make something look, feel and work so good.

I am a fun, hardworking, creative and trustworthy. I can adapt to different methodologies, I learn
quickly and keep up to date with the latest technologies. I can create new concepts with strong
narrative and storytelling. With these skills I have the confidence and motivation to succeed
designing ground breaking animations and environment pieces.

My biggest achievement at university was being nominated for the producer role in a survival
horror game. This role developed my teamwork, project planning and resource management skills.
I created asset lists, designed documentations, managed my teams workload and when the
timescales were looking tight I helped individual team members with their work.

## Key Skills

I have acquired a wide range of skills in Computer Games Design. My education has helped
develop skills such as punctuality, communication, teamwork and an eye for detail. I thrive on
working to strict deadlines and under pressure. I have worked closely with programs such as
Unity, UDK 3 and UDK 4 for level design, Autodesk Maya and 3DSmax for asset and environment
creation, Zbrush for sculpting, painting and projecting high poly detail on lower poly meshes. I
have extensive knowledge in Photoshop for compositing texture maps. I also have the relevant
skills to design documentation with strong storytelling and narratives.

###### Programs

- Adobe photoshop
- Autodesk 3Ds max
- Autodesk maya
- Zbrush
- Unity
- Unreal Engine 3 & 4
- Microsoft office packages

###### Strengths

- Environment artist
- Character rigging
- 3D animation
- Character artist
- Level designer

## Modules studied in my degree

##### 3D Animation: 2.1
My objective was to create a 30 second animation which contains hierarchical links with either
forward or inverse kinematics. The scene needed to be lit, all objects should contain a material,
particle system and space wrap were required too. I created a scene of machines working in a
factory. I learnt the principles of animation, 3dsmax constrains and problem solving skills.

##### 3D Character Animation: 2.1
My objective was to create a 40 second animation using a Dota character. The character needed
to be rigged using 3dsmax biped system and skinned. Footsteps and motion flow was
implemented by blending several unique animations such as climbing, jump role and pushing. A
clear understanding of the principles of animation was researched and implemented such as
squash and stretch.

##### Advanced Modeling and Advance Modeling in Game Engines: 1st
My objective was to redesign a fighting game character whilst working to a specific criteria brief
with strict deadlines. I studied in detail human anatomy and character workflows. I learnt how to
implement motion capture data and applying onto the model in motion builder. Importing model
and animations into UDK and presenting techniques.

##### Computer Design 1A: Design Documentation: 1st
Reverse engineering a game by recreating the design document for a game of my choosing.  All
aspects are covered from game concept, level design, storytelling, interface design (HUD),
marketing and mechanics.

##### Computer Games Design 2A and 2B: High Concept to Production and Testing: 1st
I managed a group of 25 students to create a survival horror game. My task involved organizing
students, task management, project planning, Design documentation and environment design.

##### Entertainment Research Dissertation - Character Rigging: 2.1 (69%)
I researched facial and body character rigging to create next generation, game ready, character
models. The feature setup included IK, FK snapping and blending, complex spine motions, reverse
foot rigging, morph targets for facial rigging, alongside unique eye, eyebrows and jaw systems.
Problem solving was the biggest challenge during this process. A successful character rig was
created equivalent to Disney quality.

##### Handheld Game Design: First
My objective involved creating a marvel character for a handheld game. Research involved
understanding polygon limitations and engine restrictions compared to console game characters. I
learnt CAT (Character Animation Toolkit) in 3dsmax to pose characters with animations.

##### Production Skills for Game Design: First
My objective involved creating a document which manages a small team for theme based asset
creation for a Facebook game. Tasks involved project planning, assigning tasks and design 
documentation and setting up contingencies to overcome worst case scenario.
