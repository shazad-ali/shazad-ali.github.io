## Personal Statement

I am a hardworking, unique, trustworthy and reliable individual with a wide imagination. I love to

and effectively. I love challenges and I am full of confidence who loves to expand my knowledge
and experience in various subjects. I love creating assets for games and aspire to work within
the industry as a 3D Animation Artist, Character Designer or Environment Artist. I have many
unique and interesting ideas which I would love to take further.
