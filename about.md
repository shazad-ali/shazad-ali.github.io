# A little bit about me

I graduated from Staffordshire University in 2014.

I love challenges and I am full of confidence, I enjoy learning as it helps me develop my understanding.

I enjoy creating assets for games and aspire to work within the industry as a 3D animation artist, character designer or environment artist.

I have used extensively Adobe photoshop, Autodesk 3Ds max, Autodesk maya, Zbrush, Unity and Unreal engine 4.
