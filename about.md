# A little bit about me

I graduated from Staffordshire University in 2014. I am a hardworking, trustworthy and reliable individual with a wide imagination. I love to meet new people and make new friends. I learn new skills and adapt to new experiences quickly and effectively. I love challenges and I am full of confidence who loves to expand my knowledge and experience in various subjects. I love creating assets for games and aspire to work within the industry as a 3D Animation Artist, Character Designer or Environment Artist.

I have used extensively Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk 3Ds Max, Autodesk Maya, Zbrush, Unity and Unreal Development Kit.
